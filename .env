Here is a story based assessment which is being used to measure some of the parameters related to the emotional intelligence of a human being/individual. Currently we are trying to score the individual/user on a scale by giving a prompt to the llm and asking it to score these parameters. But one of the major problem here is that this method does not seem feasible as ai gives different reults everytime we ask it to score the same quest session also we are completely unaware on what criteria does the llm scores the user. Therefore we are looking for an alternative way to score the user - I am looking for if we can integrate some ai/ml methods by building it ourselves such that everytime we run the scoring method we get consistent scores for a particular quest session also it involves some particular logic behind scoring,can you suggest which methods would be suitbale for this case and how can we implement it - like what should be the ways for implementing each method. also one of the problem is that I don't have a dataset consisting many other results of the quest session
